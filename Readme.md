## Challenges
One thing I had trouble on was setting my variables, I tried classifying each variable but I kept recieving an error message after prompts were selected. I also struggled with deploying my url and using the functionality of pushing and pulling to and from github. I believe that my biggest challenge was programming the conditional statement that links function that determined the user's password based on their input; I wasn't able to properly link each statement to the variable and kept getting a syntax error on my console.
